### Hi, I'm Sue 👋

I’m a machine learning engineer, open source contributor, and language learning
enthusiast. I sometimes build tiny projects as active learning exercises. Some
of my projects are available right here on GitHub.

I write about what I'm learning and building on [codesue.com](https://codesue.com).
