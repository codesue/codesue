### Hi, I'm Sue ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a machine learning engineer, open source contributor, and language learning
enthusiast. I sometimes build tiny projects as active learning exercises. Most
of my projects are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/codesue). Some are
also on the [ðŸ¤— Hub](https://huggingface.co/codesue).

I blog about what I'm learning on [codesue.com](https://codesue.com).
