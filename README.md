### Hi, I'm Sue 👋

I’m a machine learning engineer, open source contributor, and language learning
enthusiast. I sometimes build tiny projects as active learning exercises. Most
of my projects are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/codesue). Some are
also on the [🤗 Hub](https://huggingface.co/codesue).

I write about what I'm learning and building on [codesue.com](https://codesue.com).
